A. Choosing your NCBI pathways:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosystems/
Choose advanced search
Choose “BiosystemType” and type “pathway”
[Optional: if you want dog-specific, you can have a second field that is Organism “canis lupus familiaris”]
So your search will look like:
"pathway"[BioSystemType]
or
("pathway"[BioSystemType]) AND "canis lupus familiaris"[Organism]

If you don’t specify that it has to be dog, after you hit ‘search’ you’ll get a list of pathways, and you can restrict it just to ‘conserved Biosystems’

Then download as a .csv file (you need the CSV to create the input files for Polysel)

B. Generating the input files
You need 3 tab delimited files

1. ObjInfo.txt: this is the info on your genes: objID [the NCBI uid] objStat [the fourth root of your delta lnL] objName [the gene symbol] and then any other info columns you want
To get UIDs for my genes, I downloaded the gene2ensembl file from the NCBI ftp site and used it to go between (you’ll see in my script that some genes don’t have a 1:1 UID due to isoforms, etc. so I first used a combination of gene ID / protein ID from Ensembl, then got a few more based on just the gene ID that didn’t have isoforms): ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/

this will depend a lot on how your genes are formatted, so you’ll probably have to script it from scratch, mostly

2. SetInfo: this is the info on the pathways from biosystems. You get this from the .csv file I described in part A. You have to subset it to just have the biosystems ID number (bsid), the name, and the source (optional)

3. SetObj.txt This is the correspondence between each pathway and a gene. \
So it just has 2 columns with the bsid of the pathway and then the uid of a gene in the pathway. \
So pathways and genes will show up in multiple rows  This was the hardest for me to track down! \
I got it by downloading the biosystems_gene_all.gz file from the NCBI Biosystems FTP site: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/biosystems/biosystems.20170421/
This has info on every pathway, so then I subset to only include the biosystems I chose in part A. :)\
(Note: some pathways don’t have any genes associated with them so won’t appear in the file)

I’m attaching my preparation R script in case it helps you :)

This isn’t a complete guide, but I hope it helps you save time and get started! :)

============================================ 

This file lists associations between biosystems and Entrez Gene records
that represent biosystem components. In this file, the GO records have
been filtered out. The associations were made via the method 
described in: 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structur...rectLinksGenes. 

The file is formatted as: 

Column 1: bsid of biosystem 
Column 2: GeneID of the gene 
Column 3: score
